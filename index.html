            <p>My name is David Simionov. I was born on July 28, 2005, in Kočani. Since I was very young, I have been interested in computers and phones.
                I was honored as the Student of the Generation during my primary education. I am currently a Software Engineering student at FINKI.
                I am passionate about web development and programming, and in my free time, I enjoy going to the gym and exploring new technologies.
                I have a strong interest in Artificial Intelligence and see myself as a successful software developer in the future.
                I am always motivated to learn and grow, both professionally and personally.</p>
